## **Project Overview**  
This game involves two competing parties: **Infectors** and **Non-Infectors**, where participants navigate a series of challenges, events, and decision-making scenarios that simulate the dynamics of trust, betrayal, and cooperation during a pandemic. 

Players interact through custom-built web pages and features that guide them along the game narrative. Randomized pandemic events, such as vaccinations or new outbreaks, add unpredictability and require adaptive strategies. By integrating small physical games and scavenger hunts, participants can also earn clues to uncover a hidden box or rely on sheer luck to win rewards.  

The game was conceptualized, self-learned, and implemented in one month, and its successful execution contributed to a fantastic experience for new participants.
